We made an application prototype using Figma and Miroboard.
Problem Statement:
Nowadays, almost every household has a pet. Even though we say they are a part of
the family, we cannot provide our pets with everything they would need. Pet
owners who cannot care for their pets due to their busy work lives often leave
their pets neglected.
Currently, there are many problems faced by pet owners, like not finding good and
trusted pet products in one place, a trusted place to sell and buy pets, a place to find
a caretaker for their pet while they are away, a place where one can book a ticket
(train, flight, etc.) for their pet, somewhere to book veterinary appointments and
somewhere to find vlogs and information about their pets.


Tech stack:                                                                                                
We have used Figma for prototyping.                                                                                                                                   
Miroboard for ideating.                                                                                                                                               
Google Docs for documents.                                                                                                                         
Google forms for survey.                                                                                                               
Google Slides for final project submission.
